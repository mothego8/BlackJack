how does black jack work?

first user tells dealer how much he wishes to wager
then dealer is dealt two cards, one face up oneface down(for our sake just say one card) 
next user is dealt card at random from a 1-10, (really A->royal) 
user then recieves another card, if he likes it he can stay, if he wants another card he can hit
if he wants to split his cards he may and then must match his wager
he can aslo double down if he wishes
if after hitting he is over 21 he busts and loses his wager to dealer
if he is done hitting, dealer than hits until 17 and over or bust. 
of dealer busts or has lower hand than user, user wins
